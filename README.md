# qec_codes
Implement small quantum error-correcting codes (3-qubit repetition, 5-qubit/Steane, and a distance-d surface-code patch), simulate them under realistic noise, decode the syndromes, and compare performance and runtime when using (a) Q# simulators and (b) GPU-accelerated simulation with NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA-Quantum / cuQuantum.
